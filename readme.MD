# Adding Buffer with 10MHz Bandwidth
The project is designed in [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) (version6)
At the moment the design is not finished nor checked therefore I strongly discourage anyone from building it.

TO DO: 1) Adding additional capacitors for the linear regulators

NOTE: The +10V offset is now introduced by an LM337
